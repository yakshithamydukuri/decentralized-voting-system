# 🗳️ BlockVote: 3D Decentralized Election System

BlockVote is a high-fidelity, decentralized voting application (dApp) designed to provide a secure, transparent, and immutable platform for university-level elections. By leveraging the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet, the system ensures that every vote is verifiable and tamper-proof.
